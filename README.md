# Hotkeys
Centralized hotkey projects, custom scripts may not function properly.

For now, I've decided a centralized repo for all my hotkey projects is
a better solution than an individual repo for each. These projects can
widely range in size, can be highly customized, and have many overlapping
needs-- so I think it'd be nice to keep them close together. If some of
the projects become particularly big/standalone, I might take that one
out of here and let it stand on it's own. Projects and libraries may not
function for you out of the box. This is either because many of the scripts
are built for a specific purpose and environment, or because a script has
been modified to remove identifiable information, and so, it may not be
executable in present form.

## Project A
  
  This project is a series of scripts and libraries that I built to automate
  navigating and utilizing an in-house tool used within the department
  of a company I have worked for. The code has had minimal de-identification
  performed on it, however most of the code is complete. That said, most
  of the main scripts are useless outside of the scope of use in the
  aforementioned department of said company. The libraries can stand on
  their own, especially the GlobalLib script. All the script names, have
  been modified, and some other information has been removed. There is
  still generic information listed, to allow one to see the purpose in
  which the hotkeys have been used. The main uses have been mostly
  include/exclude search queries, page-to-page navigation, opening apps,
  and some minimal workflow error-checking.
